# PGbencher

This playbook intend to simplify bench process for PostgreSQL database.

## Dependencies

Install ansible and some dependencies

Debian based
```
apt update && apt -y install python-pip
```

Red-Hat based
```
yum install -y epel-release && yum install -y python-pip
```

Then install latest ansible and psycopg2
```
pip install ansible psycopg2
```

## Installation and Configuration
First you will need to clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/wilfriedroset/pgbencher.git && cd pgbencher
```

Copy and edit the default configuration.
```
cp defaults/main.yml config.yml
```

### Parameters
PostgreSQL related parameters:
* **pgdatabase**: name of the database to use during the bench
* **pghost**: fqdn or ip of postgresql host
* **pgport**: port of postgresql
* **pgport_ro**: read-only port of postgresql
* **pgport_rw**: read-write port of postgresql
* **pguser**: name of the user to use during bench
  * you must be a superuser or have the special CREATEDB privilege
* **pgpass**: password of the user

pgbench related parameters:
* **fillfactor**: Create the pgbench_accounts, pgbench_tellers and pgbench_branches tables with the given fillfactor. Default is 100.
* **scale_factor**: Multiply the number of rows generated by the scale factor.
* **bench_plan**: list of bench to execute.

Have a look to the official documentation for more information:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgbench.html

A bench is defined as a dictionary with:
* **bench**: type of the bench to run, one of tpcb-like, simple-update, select-only
* **client**: number of concurrent database clients
* **jobs**: number of threads
* **transactions**: number of transactions each client runs OR duration of benchmark test in seconds
  * transactions: '--transactions 100'
  * transactions: '--time 100'
* **name** (optional): name of the bench to easily identify it in summary file
* **description** (optional): description of the bench to easily understand the purpose of the bench
* **port** (optional): database server port number, will default to pgport
* **additional_options** (optional): others pgbench options, will default to none

Example
```yaml
bench_plan:
  - {name: 'bench 100 transaction on RW port',
     description: 'Bench read-write performance',
     bench: 'tpcb-like',
     port: '{{ pgport_rw }}',
     client: '{{ client }}',
     jobs: '{{ jobs }}',
     transactions: '--transactions 100',
     additional_options: '{{ additional_options }}'}
```

## Your first bench

Once configured, you can execute the playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i <host>, ./main.yml
```
Where *host* is the fqdn from which you want to run the bench.
The playbook will generate a result file formated as yaml on the host from which
you are running the playbook.

```yaml

With the results of your benchs you will also have the specs of the server from
which you have run the bench. This is basically the content of *ansible_facts*.

## Local test using docker

```
docker run --rm --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$PASS -d postgres
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/mnt -it --link some-postgres:postgres debian:stretch bash
apt update && apt -y install python-pip && pip install -q psycopg2 ansible
ansible-playbook -i localhost, /mnt/main.yml
```
